Hi there, I'm Anish Pandey 👋
I'm a Computer Science student at Caldwell University (Class of 2027, GPA 3.9) passionate about building impactful AI/ML solutions, robotics, and full-stack systems that drive real-world change. As a three-time hackathon winner (including 1st at HACKNYU x Google among 650+ participants), founder of Kampan Labs, and leader of Caldwell Robotics, I thrive on turning ideas into scalable tech for underserved communities and innovative engineering challenges.
 
🌱 What I'm Working On:
UAV Precision Agriculture Pipeline: As a Machine Learning Researcher at Caldwell University, iterating on a computer vision + HDBSCAN clustering system for drones. Recent focus: Boosting soil/vegetation segmentation accuracy to 98% and reducing chemical spraying by another 20% through LiDAR SLAM optimizations.
Sawari Transport Platform: Scaling my NGO-led app for Nepal's government, integrating 30+ transit APIs with ML-optimized routing algorithms. Next up: Adding real-time demand prediction using TensorFlow to handle 3M+ users more efficiently.
Open-Source Robotics Tools: Prototyping a modular firmware library in C++ for BLE-enabled sensors, inspired by my Lura Health internship—aiming for plug-and-play compatibility with ROS for educational makerspaces.

Check out my repos for code snippets, like Dristi or UAV-Pipeline.
🤝 What I Want to Collaborate On
I'm always up for teaming up on projects that blend AI, robotics, and social impact—especially if they push boundaries in accessibility, sustainable tech, or edge computing. Let's connect if you're into:

AI for Good: Co-developing open-source models for healthcare wearables or environmental monitoring (e.g., expanding Dristi with multi-modal sensor fusion).
Robotics & Drones: Building autonomous systems for precision tasks—think hackathon-style challenges with UAV navigation or swarm intelligence using PyTorch.
Full-Stack Dev for Non-Profits: Scaling platforms like Sawari with secure, scalable backends (Node.js + MongoDB) for global reach.
Hackathons & Mentorship: Organizing/joining events like Robot-Soccer or CalHACKS—I've mentored 6+ teams and love brainstorming firmware/design prototypes.

Shoot me a message via LinkedIn or open an issue/PR. Excited to build something awesome together! 🚀
